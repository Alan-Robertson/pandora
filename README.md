#Pandora

**Pandora** is an open-source tool for compiling, analyzing and optimizing quantum circuits through template rewrite rules. The tool can easily handle quantum circuits with tens of millions of gates, and can operate in a multi-threaded manner offering almost linear speed-ups. Pandora can apply thousands of complex circuit rewrites per second at random circuit locations.

**Pandora** is integrated with Google Qualtran. In this demo we present the installation and how to use it.

* Faster and more insightful analysis of quantum circuits
* Faster compilation for practical, fault-tolerant QC
* Faster and multi-threaded optimization for practical, fault-tolerant QC
